# Cascade Deletion Implementation for PaketKeberangkatan

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of cascade deletion for the `PaketKeberangkatan` model to ensure that when a departure package is deleted, all its related data is properly removed from the database.

## Problem Statement

The `PaketKeberangkatan` model uses Laravel's `SoftDeletes` trait, which means when a record is "deleted", it's only marked as deleted (soft delete) rather than being physically removed from the database. This prevents foreign key cascade deletion from working properly, as the database constraints only trigger on actual physical deletions.

## Solution

### 1. Custom Delete Methods

Added two custom methods to the `PaketKeberangkatan` model:

#### `cascadeDelete()`
- **Purpose**: Permanently deletes the package and all related data
- **Usage**: For normal deletion operations through the admin interface
- **Implementation**: Uses `forceDelete()` to bypass soft deletes and trigger database cascade constraints

```php
public function cascadeDelete(): bool
{
    return $this->forceDelete();
}
```

#### `permanentDelete()`
- **Purpose**: Alternative method name for permanent deletion
- **Usage**: For cases where explicit permanent deletion is needed
- **Implementation**: Identical to `cascadeDelete()`

```php
public function permanentDelete(): bool
{
    return $this->forceDelete();
}
```

### 2. Filament Resource Updates

Updated both the main resource table actions and edit page actions to use the custom delete method:

#### PaketKeberangkatanResource.php
- Modified `DeleteAction` and `DeleteBulkAction` to use `cascadeDelete()`
- Added confirmation modals with clear warnings about permanent deletion
- Updated labels to indicate cascade deletion behavior

#### EditPaketKeberangkatan.php
- Updated the header delete action to use `cascadeDelete()`
- Added comprehensive confirmation dialog
- Implemented proper redirect after deletion

### 3. Related Tables with Cascade Constraints

The following tables have foreign key constraints that cascade when `PaketKeberangkatan` is permanently deleted:

- **pendaftaran** - Registration records
- **itinerary** - Itinerary items
- **hotel** - Hotel records (set to null)
- **hotel_bookings** - Hotel booking records
- **flight_segments** - Flight segment records
- **paket_staff** - Staff assignments
- **tabungan_target** - Savings target records

## Database Constraints

All foreign key constraints are properly configured in the database:

```sql
-- Example constraints
CONSTRAINT `pendaftaran_paket_keberangkatan_id_foreign` 
    FOREIGN KEY (`paket_keberangkatan_id`) 
    REFERENCES `paket_keberangkatan` (`id`) 
    ON DELETE CASCADE

CONSTRAINT `itinerary_paket_keberangkatan_id_foreign` 
    FOREIGN KEY (`paket_keberangkatan_id`) 
    REFERENCES `paket_keberangkatan` (`id`) 
    ON DELETE CASCADE
```

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use Each Method

1. **Regular Deletion (Soft Delete)**
   ```php
   $paket->delete(); // Only marks as deleted, preserves data
   ```

2. **Cascade Deletion (Permanent)**
   ```php
   $paket->cascadeDelete(); // Permanently deletes with all related data
   ```

3. **Force Delete (Direct)**
   ```php
   $paket->forceDelete(); // Direct permanent deletion
   ```

### Admin Interface Behavior

- **Delete Button**: Now labeled as "Delete (Cascade)" with clear warnings
- **Confirmation Modal**: Explains that ALL related data will be permanently deleted
- **Bulk Actions**: Support cascade deletion for multiple records
- **No Undo**: Emphasizes that the action cannot be reversed

## Testing Results

Comprehensive testing confirmed that all related records are properly cascaded:

✅ **pendaftaran** - Registration records deleted  
✅ **itinerary** - Itinerary items deleted  
✅ **hotel** - Hotel records handled (set to null where appropriate)  
✅ **hotel_bookings** - Hotel booking records deleted  
✅ **flight_segments** - Flight segment records deleted  
✅ **tabungan_target** - Savings target records deleted  

## Important Notes

1. **Irreversible Action**: Cascade deletion permanently removes data and cannot be undone
2. **Soft Delete Preservation**: Regular `delete()` method still works for soft deletion
3. **Database Integrity**: All foreign key constraints are maintained
4. **User Confirmation**: Admin interface requires explicit confirmation before deletion
5. **Performance**: Cascade deletion is handled at the database level for efficiency

## Migration History

The cascade deletion constraints were established in migration:
`2025_10_27_025630_fix_cascade_deletion_constraints_for_paket_keberangkatan.php`

## Future Considerations

- Consider adding audit logging for cascade deletions
- Implement backup/restore functionality for accidentally deleted packages
- Add role-based permissions for cascade deletion operations
- Consider implementing a "archive" status as an alternative to deletion
